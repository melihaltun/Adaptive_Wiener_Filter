# Adaptive_Wiener_Filter
Adaptive Wiener filter implementation

This code contains a Wiener filter implementation that can modify noise variance. This in turn enables the filter to adjust filtering strength during run-time. 

The testAdaptiveFilter.cpp file provides an example use case. 

The input and the output of the example is plotted below:
